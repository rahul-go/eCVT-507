\subsection{Detailed Description}
Header for a class that implements a hall effect sensor to measure wheel speed. 

This class allows the user to implement a hall effect sensor to meausre wheel speed. It relies on the user to set up an interrupt service routine to call the calculate function on the rising or falling edge of the signal from a hall effect sensor measuring wheel speed.

Constructor which creates and initializes a wheel speed object. 

This constructor creates an wheel speed object with the given number of triggers. It saves the number of triggers and initializes the \char`\"{}previous\char`\"{} and \char`\"{}current\char`\"{} times. 
\begin{DoxyParams}{Parameters}
{\em triggers} & The number of triggers per wheel revolution. \\
\hline
\end{DoxyParams}

Update the current time and previous time to calculate the wheel speed. 

This function stores the \char`\"{}current\char`\"{} time as the previous time and assign the current time to current time. These values can be used to calculate the wheel speed, but this calculation is left until the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_wheel_speed_a1b830e36d556de4f9aa6c2a1e4100fd8}{get()}} function is called to minimize the time spent in the interrupt service routing. \mbox{\Hypertarget{class_wheel_speed_a1b830e36d556de4f9aa6c2a1e4100fd8}\label{class_wheel_speed_a1b830e36d556de4f9aa6c2a1e4100fd8}}

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{get()}{get()}}
{\footnotesize\ttfamily float Wheel\+Speed\+::get (\begin{DoxyParamCaption}{ }\end{DoxyParamCaption})}



Return the wheel speed in rotations per second. 

This function calculates the wheel speed using the stored previous time and stored current time. The time between triggers is multipled by the number of triggers to calculate the time required for one revolution in microseconds. The constant 1\+E6 is divided by this time to get rotations per second. \begin{DoxyReturn}{Returns}
The wheel speed in rotations per second as a float. 
\end{DoxyReturn}
