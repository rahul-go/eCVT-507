\subsection{Detailed Description}
Source code for a class that implements a P\+ID Controller. 

This class allows the user to implement a P\+ID Controller. It is given a setpoint, low saturation, high saturation, and Kp, Ki, and Kd gain values. In addition to providing P\+ID output, the class accounts for integral windup by disabling the integral term if the output is determined as saturated. The class can also serve as a P-\/\+Only, PI, or PD controller by setting the appropriate gains to 0, although this does result in some unnecessary calculations.
